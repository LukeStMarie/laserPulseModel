function out = pulseMSD3(x,idealTimes,repRate)
% calculates the mean square displacement of digitized pulses from ideal
% pulses, 'idealTimes,' mod the laser repetition rate, 'repRate'
%
% All times are in nanoseconds.
%
% Inputs:
%  x - input from fmincon, containing the fractions of the repetition rate
%      at which the digital pulses will arrive, mod rep rate
%  idealTimes - the theoretically ideal pulse arrival times
%  repRate - the repetition time of the laser
%
% Outputs:
%  The function computes the sum of the squared time differences between
%  each ideal pulse and its nearest digital pulse. This function is
%  intended to be used as the input for a call to fmincon, which will
%  optimize the choice of digital arrival times.

out = 0;

modTimes = mod(idealTimes,repRate);

% construct the possible delay lines; offset added last
% NOTE: this version accomodates pi/2 pulses, so the delays incorporating
%       both x(2) and x(3) are no longer useable
digTimes = repRate*([0; x(2); x(3); x(4); x(2)+x(4); x(3)+x(4)]+x(1)*ones(6,1));
perShift = repRate*ones(length(digTimes),1); % time of one repetition of laser
allTimes = [digTimes; digTimes+perShift; digTimes-perShift];

% here we find the nearest pulse, either in this set of digital pulses or an
% adjacent one, for each real pulse
nearPulses = dsearchn(allTimes,modTimes);

% sum individual MSDs
for i = 1:length(idealTimes)
    out = out + (allTimes(nearPulses(i),1)-modTimes(i,1))^2;
